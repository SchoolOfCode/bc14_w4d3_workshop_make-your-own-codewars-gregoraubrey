Title: STRINGS-TO-SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE
Description:

Your task is to create a function that takes in one or more arguments and returns a single string comprised of all the arguments (in input order) glued together.

The string your function returns should be in SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE, with any hyphens, spaces, and underscores in the input argument(s) all marking the start of a new word.

Each argument should be separated from the next by a single hyphen in the output string.

If any of the arguments are not strings, they should be converted to strings before being glued to the other arguments.

If any of the arguments contain multiple spaces, hyphens or underscores in a row, these should all be replaced with a single hyphen in each case.

For example:

ToScreamingKebab("one_two three-four") should return "ONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR".
ToScreamingKebab("FiVE-sIx_seVen EIGHT") should return "FIVE-SIX-SEVEN-EIGHT"
ToScreamingKebab("NINE", "Te-N", "ELE VEN", 12) should return "NINE-TE-N-ELE-VEN-12"
ToScreamingKebab("Th   ir___TE---EN") should return "TH-IR-TE-EN"
