Title: STRINGS-TO-SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE
Description:

Your task is to create a function that takes in one or more strings as an argument and returns a single string comprised of all the arguments (in input order) glued together.

The string your function returns should be in SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE, with hypens, spaces, and underscores in the input strings all marking the start of a new word.

Each argument should be separated from the next by a single hyphen in the output string.

If the arguments are not strings, they should be converted to strings before being concatenated.

For example:

ToScreamingKebab("one_two three-four") should return "ONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR".
ToScreamingKebab("FiVE-sIx_seVen EIGHT") should return "FIVE-SIX-SEVEN-EIGHT"
ToScreamingKebab("NINE", "Te-N", "ELE VEN", 12) should return "NINE-TE-N-ELE-VEN-12"
